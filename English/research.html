                    <p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are enigmatic and energetic stellar explosions, releasing enormous energy
                        of &sim;10<sup>51</sup> erg as gamma rays within a short timescale of seconds to minutes.
                        A key milestone in GRB studies is the consensus that the emission comes from relativistic jets
                        reaching Lorentz factors of &Gamma; &#8819; 100.
                        One of the major problems in high-energy astrophysics is to understand the acceleration and
                        emission mechanisms of these powerful and fast relativistic jets.
                        For these problems, the fractions of magnetic energy, rest-mass energy, and thermal energy
                        contained in the jet are crucial.
                        To obtain these fractions, it is important to estimate the radius <i>R</i> and Lorentz factor
                        &Gamma; of the jet at the dissipation region.</p>

                    <p>However, these quantities are difficult to estimate because the main burst, or prompt emission,
                        lasts only 10–100 seconds, and the gamma-ray spectrum does not provide clear diagnostic
                        features.
                        This has kept the problem unsolved for decades.
                        In this context, I address this problem by focusing on the period 100–1000 seconds after the
                        prompt emission.
                        During this time, X-ray telescopes often detect jet-related emissions known as X-ray flares
                        (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs).
                        This time window is a unique opportunity to study the jet and the central engine.</p>

                    <p>Recently developed instruments, such as SVOM and CTAO, can respond within minutes and detect
                        these emissions in the ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray bands, offering new
                        opportunities to probe the jet during XFs and EEs.
                        Moreover, simultaneous high-energy neutrino observations may provide further clues to the
                        dissipation mechanism.
                        My research theoretically calculates the expected multiwavelength and multi-messenger signals
                        from the dissipation region during XFs and EEs.
                        I find that very-high-energy gamma rays, ultraviolet emission, and high-energy neutrinos are
                        especially useful for constraining the dissipation radius and the Lorentz factor.
                        Comparing these theoretical predictions with future multi-messenger observations of XFs and EEs
                        will provide important clues to the jet composition and the nature of the central engine in
                        GRBs.</p>
